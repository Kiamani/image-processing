Training a model to create caption for images
Hi there!
This is just a temporarily describtion. In this project I've used Deep learnign algorithms to train my datas as follow.
The program downloads ms-coco image dataset. Not the whole dataset actually, I trained 20000 images with 30000 captions as some of the pictures had two or more captions.
Then the images were preprocessed using inceptionV3
Further steps will be provided within next few weeks. Feel free to contact me for more information by then.
